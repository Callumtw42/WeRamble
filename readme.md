WeRamble App

How to use:

1. Install React Native and get a basic helloworld app working. Im using android with the React Native CLI for testing but ios should work fine too. https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
2. Once you've successfully got your helloworld app working 'clone this repo, open terminal in folder and run "npm install"
3. Change the value of "ip" in utils.js to your ipv4 address (this should begin with 192.168.1...) this will allow the app to find the server.
4. Run "npm run server" to start the server
5. Run "npm run android" or "npm run ios" to run the app in an emulator. If your phone is plugged into your computer with usb debugging enabled, it will open on your phone instead.
6. See todo.txt for jobs
